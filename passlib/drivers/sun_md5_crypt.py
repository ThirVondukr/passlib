"""passlib.drivers.sun_md5_crypt - Sun's Md5 Crypt, used on Solaris

.. warning::

    This implementation has not been fully tested
    (particularly on an actual Solaris system)
    and so may not match the real implementation.
    it still needs work, and in particular,
    test cases to run against.

This code was written based on the algorithm
described in the passlib documentation,
combined with trial and error based on a
small number of known password/hash pairs.
It may have some border case issues.
