"""passlib.hash stub

NOTE:
  this module does not actually contain any hashes.
  this file is a stub which is replaced by a proxy object,
  which lazy-loads hashes as requested.

  the actually implementations of hashes (at least, those built into passlib)
  are stored in the passlib.drivers subpackage.
