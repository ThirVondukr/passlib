# this is the PassLib default policy configuration, used by CryptContext
# objects which don't have an explicit base policy specified.
# the goal of this default configuration is not to set any preferred schemes,
# but provide sane defaults (eg rounds) for all the supported algorithms.

#TODO: need to generate min rounds for specific cpu speed & verify time limitations
