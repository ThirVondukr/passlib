:class:`passlib.hash.apr_md5_crypt` - Apache MD5-Crypt password hash
====================================================================

.. currentmodule:: passlib.hash

This format is a variation of :class:`~passlib.hash.md5_crypt`,
primarily used by the Apache webserver in ``htpasswd`` files.
It contains only minor changes to md5-crypt, and should
be considered just as strong / weak as md5-crypt itself.

.. seealso:: :doc:`passlib.hash.md5_crypt`

Usage
=====
This algorithm can be used in exactly the same way as :class:`~passlib.hash.md5_crypt`,
see that class for details.

Interface
=========
.. autoclass:: apr_md5_crypt(checksum=None, salt=None, strict=False)

Format & Algorithm
==================
This format and algorithm of Apache's MD5-Crypt is identical
to the original MD5-Crypt, except for two changes:

1. The encoded string uses ``$apr1$`` as it's prefix, while md5-crypt uses ``$1$``.

2. The algorithm uses ``$apr1$`` as a constant in the step where md5-crypt uses
   ``$1$`` in it's calculation of `digest B <md5-crypt-constant-insertion>`_.
   Because of this change, even raw checksums generated by apr-md5-crypt and md5-crypt
   are not compatible with eachother.
