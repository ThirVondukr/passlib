:samp:`passlib.hash.pbkdf2_{digest}` - Generic PBKDF2 Hashes
===============================================================

.. index:: pbkdf2 hash; generic mcf

.. currentmodule:: passlib.hash

PassLib provides three custom hash schemes based on the PBKDF2 [#pbkdf2]_ algorithm
which are compatible with the :ref:`modular crypt format <modular-crypt-format>`:
:class:`!pbkdf2_sha1`, :class:`!pbkdf2_sha256`, :class:`!pbkdf2_sha512`.
They feature variable length salts, variable rounds.

Security-wise, PBKDF2 is currently one of the leading key derivation functions,
and has no known security issues.
Though the original PBKDF2 specification uses the SHA-1 message digest,
it is not vulnerable to any of the known weaknesses of SHA-1 [#hmac-sha1]_,
and can be safely used. However, for those still concerned, SHA-256 and SHA-512
versions are offered as well.

    Alternate version of these hashes - :doc:`LDAP-Compatible Simple PBKDF2 Hashes <passlib.hash.ldap_pbkdf2_digest>`

Usage
=====
These classes support both rounds and salts,
and can be used in the exact same manner
as :doc:`SHA-512 Crypt <passlib.hash.sha512_crypt>`.

Interface
=========
.. class:: pbkdf2_sha1()

    except for the choice of message digest,
    this class is the same as :class:`pbkdf2_sha512`.

.. class:: pbkdf2_sha256()

    except for the choice of message digest,
    this class is the same as :class:`pbkdf2_sha512`.

.. autoclass:: pbkdf2_sha512()

.. _mcf-pbkdf2-format:

Format & Algorithm
==================
An example :class:`!pbkdf2_sha256` hash (of ``password``)::

    $pbkdf2-sha256$6400$.6UI/S.nXIk8jcbdHx3Fhg$98jZicV16ODfEsEZeYPGHU3kbrUrvUEXOPimVSQDD44

All of the pbkdf2 hashes defined by passlib
follow the same format, :samp:`$pbkdf2-{digest}${rounds}${salt}${checksum}`.

* :samp:`$pbkdf2-{digest}$`` is used as the :ref:`modular-crypt-format` identifier
  (``$pbkdf2-sha256$`` in the example).

* :samp:`{digest}` - this specifies the particular cryptographic hash
  used in conjunction with HMAC to form PBKDF2's pseudorandom function
  for that particular hash (``sha256`` in the example).

* :samp:`{rounds}` - the number of iterations that should be performed.
  this is encoded as a positive decimal number with no zero-padding
  (``6400`` in the example).

* :samp:`{salt}` - this is the :func:`adapted base64 encoding <passlib.utils.adapted_b64_encode>`
  of the raw salt bytes passed into the PBKDF2 function.

* :samp:`{checksum}` - this is the :func:`adapted base64 encoding <passlib.utils.adapted_b64_encode>`
  of the raw derived key bytes returned from the PBKDF2 function.
  Each scheme uses output size of it's specific :samp:`{digest}`
  as the size of the raw derived key. This is enlarged
  by appromixately 4/3 by the base64 encoding,
  resulting in a checksum size of 27, 43, and 86 for each of the respective algorithms.

The algorithm used by all of these schemes is deliberately identical and simple:
The password is encoded into UTF-8 if not already encoded,
and passed through :func:`~passlib.utils.pbkdf2.pbkdf2`
along with the decoded salt, the number of rounds,
and a prf built from HMAC + the respective message digest.
The result is then encoded using :func:`~passlib.utils.adapted_b64_encode`.
