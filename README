==========================

Welcome
=======
PassLib is a password hash library, which provides cross-platform
implementations of over 20 password hashing algorithms; as well as a framework for managing
and migrating existing password hashes. It's designed to be useful
for any task from quickly verifying a hash found in /etc/shadow,
to providing full-strength password hashing for multi-user application.

The latest documentation can be found online at `<http://packages.python.org/passlib>`_.

* Python 2.5 - 2.7
* PyBCrypt or BCryptor (optional; required only if bcrypt support is needed)
* M2Crypto (optional; accelerates PBKDF2-based hashes)
